  \notabene{The symbol $\therefore$ is occasionally used in this document, and is a mathematical mark meaning ``therefore''. Additionally, there is a frequent use of the Greek alphabet. See \textit{Appendix II} on page \pageref{ssec:greek-alphabet} for a list of Greek alphabetical characters. For a diagram of the unit circle|a source of useful trigonometric information|see \textit{Appendix II} on page \pageref{ssec:unit-circle}} 

  \notabene{The \textit{right-hand rule} is useful in determining arbitrary direction and axes. Wrap your open right hand around the object in the direction of its rotation; the direction indicated by your upwardly-pointing thumb may be considered north or the positive direction. You will see this rule a lot in your studies of physics in various applications, specifically with regards to torques and electromagnetism.}

  \notabene{The inverse trigonometric functions are determined by reflecting the graphs of the basic trigonometric functions over the line $y=x$. In this manner, $y=\sin x$ becomes $x=\sin y$ which becomes $y=\arcsin x$}
