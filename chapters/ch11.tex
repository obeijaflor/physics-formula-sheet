  \tablesubsection{Specific Heat}

  \(c\equiv\displaystyle\frac{Q}{m\Delta T}\) & Yields specific heat if a quantity of energy $Q$ is transferred to a substance mass $m$ and changes its temperature by $\Delta T$ in \si{\joule\per\kilo\gram\per\celsius} \\
  \(Q=mc\Delta T\) & Yields the amount of energy $Q$ required to raise the temperature of an object mass $m$ with specific heat $c$ by $\Delta T$\si{\celsius} \\

  \tablesubsection{Latent Heat \& Phase Change}

  \(Q=\pm mL\) & Yields the energy $Q$ required to change the phase (solid, liquid, gas, etc.) of a pure substance mass $m$ with latent heat $L$ \\

  \notabene{Phase change involves a change in internal energy, but no change in temperature}

  \tablesubsection{Energy Transfer}

  \(P = \displaystyle\frac{Q}{\Delta t}\propto A\frac{\Delta T}{\Delta x}\) & Yields the power $P$ required to conduct a quantity of energy $Q$ across time interval $\Delta t$ on a surface of cross-sectional area $A$ and thickness $\Delta x$ by $\Delta T$\si{\celsius} \\
  \(P = kA\displaystyle\frac{\Delta T}{L}\) & An alternate form of the previous equation where $k$ is the proportionality constant of thermal conductivity and $\Delta x=L$ \\
  \(P = \sigma AeT^4\) & \textit{Stefan's Law} yields the rate at which an object radiates energy where $P$ is the power $\sigma=\SI{5.6696e-8}{\watt\per\meter\squared\per\kelvin^4}$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant $A$ is the surface area of the object $e$ is the emissivity constant of the object and $T$ is the temperature in \si{\kelvin} \\
  \(P_{net}=\sigma Ae\Delta T^4\) & Yields the net power gained or lost each second for an object where the object and its surroundings have a difference in temperature $\Delta T$ \\

  \notabene{An ideal absorber is an object that absorbs all the light radiation incident on it, including invisible radiation such as infrared and ultraviolet light. Such an object is called a black body because at room-temperature it would appear to be black. A perfect black body has emissivity $e=1$. Though black bodies reflect no radiation, they emit characteristic radiation (except those at absolute zero). An ideal reflector is an object which reflects all energy incident on it with an emissivity $e=0$}
