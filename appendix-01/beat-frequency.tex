  \caption{A diagram of the beat frequency between the waves $y_1$ and $y_2$ as traveling in the same direction where the beat frequency $f_b=\abs{f_2-f_1}$. The nodes of the combined wave occur where $y_1$ and $y_2$ are out of phase|that is, they have opposite amplitudes---and the antinodes of the combined wave occur where $y_1$ and $y_2$ are in phase---that is, they have equal amplitudes}
