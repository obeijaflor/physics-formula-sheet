  \caption{A representation of a shock wave, produced when a source moves from $S_0$ to $S_n$ with a speed $\vec{v}_s$ which is greater than the wave speed $\vec{v}$ in the medium where the radius of each circle surrounding a point $S_x$ is $\vec{v}t$, the velocity $\vec{v}$ of sound in the medium multiplied by $t$, the amount of time elapsed since the source of the sound was at a point $S_x$}

  \(\displaystyle\sin\theta=\frac{\vec{v}}{\vec{v}_s} \therefore \theta=\arcsin\left(\frac{\vec{v}}{\vec{v}_s}\right)\) & Yields the angle $\theta$ between a line tangent to a circle and the direction of motion of the sound source where $\vec{v}$ is the speed of sound in a that medium and $\vec{v}_s$ is the velocity of the sound source in that medium \\

  \notabene{The ratio $\frac{\vec{v}}{\vec{v}_s}$ is the \textit{Mach number}. The conical wave front produced when $\vec{v}_s > \vec{v}$ (supersonic speeds) is known as a shock wave. An interesting example of a shock wave is the bow wave of a boat when the boat's speed exceeds the speed of the water waves}
