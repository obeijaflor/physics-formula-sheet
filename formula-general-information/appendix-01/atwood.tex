An Atwood device in the form of a frictionless pulley $P$ where $m_1$ is placed on an inclined surface while $m_2$ remains in free-fall. $F_f$ is the force of friction acting on $m_1$ by the inclined surface. $\theta$ is the angle between the inclined surface and a vector in the direction of the force of gravity $\vec{F}_g$.

For very small mass differences between $m_1$ and $m_2$, the rotational inertia $I$ of any pulley $P$ of radius $r$ cannot be neglected. The angular acceleration of the pulley is given by the no-slip condition:

\begin{longtable}{p{0.45\textwidth} p{0.45\textwidth}}
    \( \displaystyle \alpha = \frac{a}{r} \) & Yields the angular acceleration $\alpha$ \\
    \(\displaystyle \tau_{net}=\left(T_1 - T_2 \right)r - \tau_f = I \alpha \) & Yields the net torque $\tau_{net}$ where $\tau_f$ is the torque due to friction and $\Delta T$ is the difference in tensions $T_1$ and $T_2$ due to $m_1$ and $m_2$ \\
\end{longtable}

Combining Newton's second law for the hanging masses and solving for $T_1$, $T_2$, and $a$, we get:

\begin{longtable}{p{0.45\textwidth} p{0.45\textwidth}}
    \( \displaystyle a = \frac{g \left(m_1 - m_2 \right) - \left( \frac{\tau_f}{r} \right)}{m_1 + m_2 + \left(\frac{I}{r^2} \right)}\) & Yields the acceleration of the Atwood system \\
    \(\displaystyle T_1 = \frac{m_1 g \left(2 m_2 + \frac{I}{r^2} + \frac{\tau_f}{r g} \right)}{m_1 + m_2 + \left(\frac{I}{r^2} \right)}\) & Tension in the string segment nearest $m_1$ \\
    \(\displaystyle T_2 = \frac{m_2 g \left(2 m_1 + \frac{I}{r^2} + \frac{\tau_f}{r g}\right)}{m_1 + m_2 + \left(\frac{I}{r^2}\right)} \) & Tension in the string segment nearest $m_2$
\end{longtable}

Should bearing friction be negligible (but not the inertia of the pulley and not the traction of the string on the pulley rim), the equations simplify as the following results:

\begin{longtable}{p{0.3\textwidth} p{0.3\textwidth} p{0.3\textwidth}}
    \( \displaystyle a = \frac{g \left(m_1 - m_2 \right)}{m_1 + m_2 + \frac{I}{r^2}} \) &
    \( \displaystyle T_1 = \frac{m_1 g \left(2 m_2 + \frac{I}{r^2} \right)}{m_1 + m_2 + \frac{I}{r^2}} \) &
    \( \displaystyle T_2 = \frac{m_2 g \left(2 m_1 + \frac{I}{r^2} \right)}{m_1 + m_2 + \frac{I}{r^2}} \) \\
\end{longtable}

These examples provide but some of the many Atwood device situations you may encounter in your journey through the world of physics.
