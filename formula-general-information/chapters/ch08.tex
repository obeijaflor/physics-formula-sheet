  \tablesubsection{Torque}

  \(\vec{\tau} = \vec{r}\vec{F}\) & Yields torque $\tau$ where $r$ is the length of the position vector between point $O$ and $F$ the magnitude of the force applied perpendicularly to $r$, measured in \si{\newton\meter} \\
  \(\tau = rF\sin\theta\) & Yields torque where $F$ is applied at an angle not equal to \SI{90}{\degree} from $r$ \\
  \(\tau_{net}=\tau_1+\tau_2+\ldots+\tau_n\) & Yields the net torque acting on an object at rest \\
  
  \notabene{The vectors $\vec{r}$ and $\vec{F}$ lie in a plane. Additionally, torque is the rotational analogue for force. The rate of rotation of an object does not change unless the object is acted on by a net torque}
  \notabene{The \underline{Right Hand Rule} applies to torques. Point your index finger toward the direction in which $F$ is acting. Your thumb points in the direction in which $\tau$ is acting}

  \tablesubsection{Torque \& the Two Conditions for Equilibrium}

  \begin{tabular}{l l}
    \(\sum\vec{F}=0\) & \(\sum\vec{\tau}=0\)
  \end{tabular} & The two conditions for equilibrium \\

  \tablesubsection{The Center of Gravity}

  \(\displaystyle\frac{\sum m_ix_i}{\sum m_i}\) & Yields the center of gravity along the $x$-axis where $m_i$ is the mass of the object at point $x_i$. This formula can be applied to the $y$- and $z$-axes \\

  \notabene{The net gravitational torque on an object is zero if computed around the center of gravity. The object will balance if supported at that point or any point along a vertical line above or below that point}

  \tablesubsection{Relationship Between Torque \& Angular Acceleration}

  \(\tau = mr^2\alpha\) & Yields the torque acting on an object about its axis of rotation \\
  \(I\equiv\sum mr^2\) & Yields the moment of inertia $I$ for an object as a sum of the constants of proportionality $mr^2$ of that object in \si{\kilo\gram\meter\squared} \\
  \(\sum\tau = I\alpha\) & Rotational analog of Newton's second law \\

  \notabene{The moment of inertia of a system depends on how the mass is distributed and on the location of the axis of rotation}

  \tablesubsection{Rotational Energy}

  \(KE_r = \frac{1}{2}I\omega^2\) & Yields rotational kinetic energy \\
  \(\left(KE_t + KE_r + PE\right)_i = \left(KE_t + KE_r + PE\right)_f\) & The conservation of mechanical energy \\
  \(W_{nc} = \Delta KE_t + \Delta KE_r + \Delta PE\) & Yields nonconservative work \\
  \(W=\tau\theta\) & Yields rotational work \\
  \(P=\tau\omega\) & Yields rotational power \\
  \(W_{net}=\Delta KE=\frac{1}{2}\left(\omega_f^2-\omega_i^2\right)\) & Rotational equivalent of the Work-Energy Theorem \\
  \(J=\tau t=I\Delta\omega\) & Angular impulse, causing a change in the momentum of a body \\
  \(I=I_{cm}+Mh^2\) & The \textit{Parallel-Axis Theorem}, providing the moment of inertia $I$ of a body about any axis parallel to the axis passing through the centre of mass; $I_{cm}$ is the moment of inertia about an axis through the center of mass, $M$ is the total mass of the body, and $h$ is the perpendicular distance between the two parallel axes \\
  
  \notabene{See \textit{Appendix II} on page \pageref{ssec:moment-inertia} for details on the specific moments of inertia $I$ for various shapes}

  \tablesubsection{Angular Momentum}

   \(L \equiv I\omega\) & The angular momentum of an object, measured in \si{\kilo\gram\meter\squared\per\second} \\
   
   \(\displaystyle\sum\tau = \frac{\textrm{change in angular momentum}}{\textrm{time interval}} = \frac{\Delta L}{\Delta t}\) & The rotational analogue of Newton's second law, which can be written in the form \(F = \frac{\Delta p}{\Delta t}\) and states that the net torque acting on an object is equal to the time rate of change of the object's angular momentum \\
   
\notabene{If $L_i$ and $L_f$ are the angular momenta of a system at two different times and there is no external torque (thus $\sum\tau = 0$), then \(L_i = L_f\); thus angular momentum is conserved. This is the \textit{Law of Conservation of Angular Momentum}. If the moment of inertia of an isolated rotating system changes, the system's angular speed will change. Thus, conservation of angular momentum requires that \(I_i\omega_i = I_f\omega_f\) if \(\sum\tau = 0\).}
