  \tablesubsection{Heat Engines \& the Second Law of Thermodynamics}

  \(\Delta U=0=Q+W \rightarrow Q_{net}=-W=W_{eng}\) & Relates the work done by a heat engine $W_{eng}$ to the net energy absorbed by the engine $Q_{net}$ \\
  \(W_{eng} = Q_{net} = \abs{\Delta Q}\) & Yields the work done by a heat engine $W_{eng}$ where $\Delta Q$ is the thermal energy transferred by the engine \\

  \tablesubsection{Entropy}

  \(\Delta S\equiv\displaystyle\frac{Q_r}{T}\) & Yields the change in entropy $\Delta S$ in \si{\joule\per\kelvin} where $Q_r$ is the energy absorbed or expelled during a reversible, constant temperature process between two equilibrium states and $T$ is the temperature in \si{\kelvin} \\
  \(S = k_B\ln W\) & An alternate definition of entropy $S$ where $k_B=\SI{1.38e-23}{\joule\per\kelvin}$ is Boltzmann's Constant and $W$ is a number proportional to the probability the system has a particular configuration. This formula is a result of the fact that isolated systems tend toward greater disorder, and entropy is a measure of that disorder \\
